          I'm a open minded, project oriented PhD Fellow in Bayesian Deep Learning (previously MSc in Electronic Engineering and MSc in Computer Engineering), always looking for new and exiting challenges. I love working out of my comfort zone, dealing with new environments and heterogeneous projects. My current research interests include Bayesian Machine Learning and Deep Learning and their potential to be implemented on high-performance systems and on custom hardware (notably on FPGAs).
